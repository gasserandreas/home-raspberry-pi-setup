# Install & configure git

1. check if git is installed `git -v`
2. verify if there is already a SSH key: `ls -al ~/.ssh`
3. if there is no SSH key (look for `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`) create SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
4. copy SSH key to clipboard: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
5. paste public SSH key to GitHub settings: https://github.com/settings/keys
